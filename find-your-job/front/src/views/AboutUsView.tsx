      <p className="mb-4">
        FINDyourJOB was born from a place of frustration—but also from the determination to make things better.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My name is Gian Luca Caravone. I’m a Full Stack Web Developer who has been studying programming for the past two years—one year self-taught, and the other through formal academic training.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Like many others, I spent over a year actively searching for a job. Day after day, I jumped from one platform to another, hoping to find an opportunity that would let me show my skills. But instead of progress, I found endless loops—job portals that redirected me to other sites, repetitive forms, and no clear way to know whether my application even mattered.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All I wanted was something simple: the ability to upload my CV, answer my recruiter’s questions directly, and at the very least, get a clear response—even if it was a "no." I wanted feedback. I wanted closure. I wanted fairness.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        That’s when I decided to build <strong>FINDyourJOB</strong>—a platform designed by a job seeker, for job seekers. This is more than a job board. It’s a space that respects your time, your effort, and your need for clarity.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our mission is to simplify the application process, reduce candidate anxiety, and provide value at every step. Whether it’s through smarter search tools, simplified submissions, or actionable feedback from recruiters, we want you to feel that your time and energy are well spent.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We also provide professional development advice and tips to help you grow—not just to find a job, but to become a stronger, more confident version of yourself.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-6 font-semibold text-green-700">
        Because everyone deserves a chance to be seen—and FINDyourJOB is here to make that happen.
